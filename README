Basic how-to:

>>> import publish2
>>> p2 = publish2.get_for_journalist("Ryan Sholin") # fetches your 100 latest links as a feed
>>> my_links = p2.items # the actual links
>>> my_links[0].title # each item has a title, link, publication_name, publication_date, created_date, tags, description, some other stuff

# filter your feed
>>> p2 = publish2.get_for_journalist("Chris Amico", topic="politics") # not case sensative, will be slugified
>>> p2 = publish2.get_for_newsgroup("NewsHour", topic="Barack Obama")

# or just get any feed
>>> p2 = publish2.get_feed("http://www.publish2.com/recent") # this is buggy. Add .rss or .json for better results
